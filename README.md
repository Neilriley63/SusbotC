# SusbotC


***Don't be suspicious***

This is my first attempt at learning C# by creating a Discord bot that allows people to be declared as sus. It also has some other random actions so that I don't need to make more than one bot.
  
This code is heavily influenced by NinjaBot, which is the first Discord bot I could find written in C#, so a lot of my learning comes from that.

## Commands

!sus <name> to generate a random declaration of the named person as sus.
  
!conjure <1,2,3,4,dan> to conjure an animal from DnD 5e based on the conjure animal spell. The number indicates how many creatures are summoned as per the spell contents. You can also summon Dan.

!sus and !conjure also have help commands (i.e. !sus help or !conjure help) that describe the commands.

!susinfo will reply with information about the bot, as well as a link to this repo.

## Current goals

1. Add more susses
2. ???
3. Profit

## Future ideas

1. Voice chat capabilities to play Among Us (or other random) sounds when prompted
