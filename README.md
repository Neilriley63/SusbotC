# SusbotC


***Don't be suspicious***

This is my first attempt at learning C# by creating a Discord bot that allows people to be declared as sus.  
  
This code is heavily influenced by NinjaBot, which is the first Discord bot I could find written in C#, so a lot of my learning comes from that.

## Current goals

1. Add more susses
2. ???
3. Profit

## Future ideas

1. Voice chat capabilities to play Among Us (or other random) sounds when prompted
