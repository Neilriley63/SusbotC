# SusbotC


***Don't be suspicious***

This is my first attempt at learning C# by creating a Discord bot that allows people to be declared as sus.  

## Current goals

1. Figure out token config so I don't accidentally post the private token on the internet again.
2. Create a "!sus <name>" command that pseudo-randomly generates a response saying something along the lines of "<name> kinda sus" "<command writer> thinks <name> is sus" etc.

## Future ideas

1. Voice chat capabilities to play Among Us (or other random) sounds when prompted
